                        <p>I have been a stay at home mom for the past thirteen years which unfortunately does not
                            add a lot of bullet points to the resume. I have been involved in PTA activities at my sons
                            school which involved organizing, decorating, and budgeting for events. I really enjoyed
                            the decorating process.
                        </p>
                        <p>I like the creative process. I would like to rejoin the workforce and perhaps
                            become an advocate of some sort for bridging the gap between technology and the 
                            mature generation.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>I have an eye and an ear for certain details. I am usually able to predict the surprise ending
                            of a movie. Also really good at impersonations. </p>
